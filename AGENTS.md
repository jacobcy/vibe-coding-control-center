# AI Agent Guide

Welcome, AI Agent. This file serves as your entry point to the Vibe Coding Control Center.

## 📍 Your Workspace
Your primary working directory for context, memory, and workflows is **`.agent/`**.

Please consult the following files for detailed instructions:

1.  **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)**: The main project context, tech stack, and development guidelines.
2.  **[SOUL.md](SOUL.md)**: The core constitution and principles you must adhere to.
3.  **[.agent/README.md](.agent/README.md)**: Detailed documentation on your workflows, context memory, and rules.

## 🤖 Protocol
Regardless of your identity (Claude, OpenCode, Codex, Trae, etc.), you are expected to:
- **Check `.agent/context/task.md`** to understand the current task status.
- **Check `.agent/context/memory.md`** for historical decisions.
- **Follow the workflows** defined in `.agent/workflows/`.
- **Respect the rules** in `.agent/rules/`.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand the project.
2.  Read `.agent/README.md` to understand your tools and workflows.
3.  Check `.agent/context/task.md` to see what needs to be done.
